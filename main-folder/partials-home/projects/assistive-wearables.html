  <span class="project-header">Assistive Wearables</span>
  <span class="project-description">We are developing an assistive wearable device that seamlessly integrates with
    everyday accessories(beginning with glasses and rings) to make them smart, efficient, and genuinely helpful.
    Designed for universal accessibility, the device effortlessly clips onto personal wearables, enhancing them with
    intelligent assistive functions that adapt to each user’s specific needs. Its modular and customizable design allows
    individuals to select features relevant to their lifestyle or disability, while maintaining comfort, aesthetics, and
    ease of use. By connecting multiple modules within a single ecosystem, this innovation transforms ordinary
    accessories into personalized assistive companions—empowering users with independence, inclusivity, and smart
    support in their daily lives.</span>
